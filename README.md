# FreeTusky

![](/fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/icon.png)

FreeTusky is a beautiful Android client for [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon). Mastodon is a GNU social-compatible federated social network. That means not one entity controls the whole network, rather, like e-mail, volunteers and organisations operate their own independent servers, users from which can all interact with each other seamlessly.

FreeTusky is a fork of [Tusky](https://github.com/tuskyapp/Tusky).

FreeTusky removes Tusky's implemented blocklist.

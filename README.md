# FreeTusky

![](/fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/icon.png)

FreeTusky is a beautiful Android client for [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon). Mastodon is a GNU social-compatible federated social network. That means not one entity controls the whole network, rather, like e-mail, volunteers and organisations operate their own independent servers, users from which can all interact with each other seamlessly.

FreeTusky removes Tusky's implemented blocklist.

## Features

- Material Design
- Most Mastodon APIs implemented

- Drafts - compose toots and save them for later
